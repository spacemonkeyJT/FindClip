# FindClip custom script for Firebot

## What is it?

This is a custom script for [Firebot](https://firebot.app/) which can be used to create a `!findclip` command which will find a clip by searching on the title.

E.g. entering the command:

`!findclip hi there`

might find a clip titled "OH, hi there, weirdo!"

If a clip is found, then the link is posted in chat.

The command will only search clips for the broadcaster's channel.
